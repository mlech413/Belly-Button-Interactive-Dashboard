# Belly-Button-Interactive-Dashboard

## An interactive dashboard was built to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## A D3 library read in JSON data from https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json

### The working files are "index.html" and  "static/js/app.js".

### The following was created on the Belly Button Interactive Dashboard page:
### * A display of each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.
### * A display of the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
### * A horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
### * A bubble chart that displays each sample.
### * A gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.
